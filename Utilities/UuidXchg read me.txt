UuidXchg v1.0 Copyright (C) 2022 David Miller
These developer's utilities are part of the Omfoo Source Code Project.
You only need these of you are compiling your own version of Omfoo.dll.
There's a GUI version and a command-line version.
They call CoCreateGuid() to update each and every __declspec(uuid) attribute in a C++ header file.
The update is done in place, so it requires write access to the file.
